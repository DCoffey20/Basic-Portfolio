            I am what people in the Nashville area call a Unicorn. That means I was born and raised in the greater Nashville area 
            and apparently that is rare. I went to high school at Merrol Hyde Magnet School in Sumner County. After high school, 
            I moved to Atlanta, GA for two years to play junior hockey. From there, hockey took me to West Virginia University where 
            I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering while playing hockey for WVU. I still play hockey today in a "beer" 
            league in Nashville.

            While in high school, I met my future ex-girlfriend/ future ex-fiance/ current wife. We married in 2016 and we two
            dogs that run our lives. Together, we enjoy traveling, spending time on the lake, going to Predators games, or eating
            pizza in bed, like we did for our second aniversary. We balance each other out and complement each others personalities
            very well and I enjoy every day with her. (Had to be nice in case she reads this.)

            I currently am a sales engineer for a manufactures rep for commercial air conditioning company. It is not the worst job
            in the world, but I don't find myself looking forward to going to work everyday and it is very stressfull. I spoke with
            a friend that had completed a bootcamp and got a job as a front end developer. Listening to her explain her job and the
            day to day of low stress and working from home got me very interested in looking into this career path. After I looked 
            into it, the more I felt like it would be for me. One of my favorite projects in college was programming a car to stay 
            so far away from a curved wall and I did all of the programming for the group. I should have taken then hint then and 
            made the change to focus on coding then, but it took me a while to wise up. Regaurdless of how I got here, here I am and
            I look forward to continuing to learn more and more every day.
